# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains CI/CD workflows for the frontend repo.

## Environment Model

- Localdev: Docker Desktop using docker-compose.yml on your local machine
- Staging: deployed to Hostinger staging_public_html after successful CI on build
- Production: deployed to Hostinger public_html on main

## Branch Flow

development -> build -> main

## Workflows

### 1) CI - Build & Test (ci.yml)

Triggers:
- Push to development and build
- Pull requests to build and main

Purpose:
- Lint and build gate for integration branches

### 2) Build Test (build-test.yml)

Triggers:
- Push to development and build
- Pull requests to build

Purpose:
- Additional build validation matrix

### 3) PR Checks (pr-checks.yml)

Triggers:
- Pull requests to build and main

Purpose:
- PR-focused checks and summary table

### 4) Deploy to Staging (deploy-staging.yml)

Triggers:
- workflow_run when CI - Build & Test completes on build
- Manual workflow_dispatch

Guard:
- Deploy job runs only when CI conclusion is success (or manual dispatch)

Purpose:
- Promote validated build commits to staging

### 5) Deploy to Production (deploy-production.yml)

Triggers:
- Push to main
- Manual workflow_dispatch

Purpose:
- Deploy production from main
